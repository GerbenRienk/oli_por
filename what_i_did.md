- created empty repository on github with only readme.md
- in eclipse: file - import - Project from Git (with smart import) - clone URI
- mind that the correct folder is selected: C:\Users\Gerben Rienk\Documents\GitHub
- right click on project, select PyDev - Set as PyDev Project
- create source-folder oli
- copy package config from oli3.1
- put oli.config in .gitignore by right-clicking on it and choosing Team - Ignore; commit and push and it works (!)
- put an example oli_example.config next to it, so others understand how it works
